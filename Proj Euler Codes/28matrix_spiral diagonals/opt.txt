First I noted that for an n by n grid, and n being odd, the number in the top right corner is n2. A little mathematical analysis told me that the other corners are given by: n2-n+1, n2-2n+2, and n2-3n+3. Adding these together gives the quadratic, 4n2-6n+6. Then all I had to do was create a loop from 3 to 1001 in steps of 2 and find the running total (starting from 1) of the quadratic.
